## Installing

1. Download the plugin - we don't currently have any accessible download links. Contact @stefan-cooper or any other contributor to retrieve a .jar file

2. Add the plugin to your `plugins` folder in your Spigot server

## Configure your UHC

You can configure your UHC in the server (see [Configuring](#configuring)) or you can create a `uhc_config.properties` file inside your `plugins` folder. One of these will be created anyway after starting the server with this plugin installed.

The following configurations are available for managing your UHC:

### Required Properties (they have defaults)

```properties
# Name of the minecraft overworld
world.name=world
# Name of the minecraft nether world
nether.world.name=world_nether
# Name of the minecraft end world
end.world.name=world_end

difficulty=EASY
# Countdown to start the game after UHC start command issued
countdown.timer.length=5
# Grace period time (in seconds) before PVP is enabled
grace.period.timer=600
# Minimum distance (in blocks) that teams/players will be spread at start of UHC
spread.min.distance=500
# World border center X coord
world.border.center.x=0
# World border center Z coord

### Optional properties:

#### World border

```properties
# (optional) world border y border. Setting this and the world.border.y.shrinking.period means that after 
#            the final xz border is finished shrinking, the y border will begin shrinking from the bottom 
#            of the map up to this coordinate by replacing the layers with bedrock.
#
#            Note: this only works if the `world.border.final.size` value is 300 or less
world.border.final.y=60
# (optional) length of time in seconds to shrink the y border by
world.border.y.shrinking.period=900
```

### Notes on running your UHC smoothly

We recommend using a plugin like [Chunky](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/) to pre-load your world chunks. This will hopefully mean less lag at the beginning of your UHC.
