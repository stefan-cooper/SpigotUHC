Run a UHC on your [Paper](https://papermc.io/) Server.

Want to contribute? See [Contributing](#contributing)

## Installing

1. Download the plugin - we don't currently have any accessible download links. Contact @stefan-cooper or any other contributor to retrieve a .jar file

2. Add the plugin to your `plugins` folder in your [Paper](https://papermc.io/) server

## Configure your UHC

You can configure your UHC in the server (see [Configuring](#configuring)) or you can create a `uhc_config.properties` file inside your `plugins` folder. One of these will be created anyway after starting the server with this plugin installed.

The following configurations are available for managing your UHC:

### Required Properties (they have defaults)

```properties
# Name of the minecraft overworld
world.name=world
# Name of the minecraft nether world
nether.world.name=world_nether

# Name of the minecraft end world
end.world.name=world_end
# Difficulty of the game when UHC is live
difficulty=EASY
# Disable debug info from being shown to clients (coordinates, chunk info, hitboxes, etc). Enabling this will show coordinates to players during the UHC in the action bar

# Grace period time (in seconds) before PVP is enabled
grace.period.timer=600

# On /uhc start, use this value to determine a minimum 'padding' that players will spawn away from the border
world.border.spawn.padding=1
# Final size of the world border at the end of the UHC
world.border.final.size=150
# Grace period time (in seconds) before the border will begin to shrink
world.border.grace.period=3600
# Initial size world border at start of the UHC
world.border.initial.size=2000
# Time (in seconds) to shrink from the initial size to the final size
world.border.shrinking.period=7200
# Action to undertake when a player dies ("spectate" | "kick")
on.death.action=spectate
# Mob grace period - period of time (in seconds) that the game will remain in 'Peaceful' mode (default: 0)

### Optional properties:

#### World border

```properties
# (optional) world border y border. Setting this and the world.border.y.shrinking.period means that after 
#            the final xz border is finished shrinking, the y border will begin shrinking from the bottom 
#            of the map up to this coordinate by replacing the layers with bedrock.
#
#            Note: this only works if the `world.border.final.size` value is 300 or less
world.border.final.y=60
# (optional) length of time in seconds to shrink the y border by
world.border.y.shrinking.period=900
```

#### Team configuration

```properties

## Commands

The following commands are available in game:

### Configuring

#### Set config value:

`/uhc set world.border.initial.size=500`

#### Set multiple config values:

`/uhc set world.border.initial.size=500 world.border.final.size=250`

#### View full config:

`/uhc view config`

#### View a specific config value:

`/uhc view world.border.initial.size`

#### Unset config value:

`/uhc unset world.border.initial.size`

#### Unset multiple config values:

`/uhc unset world.border.initial.size world.border.final.size`

### Running

#### Start the UHC:

`/uhc start`

#### Start a UHC midway/resume a UHC

`/uhc resume <minutes>`

e.g: `/uhc resume 30`

#### Randomise teams:

`/uhc randomise <teamSize>`

e.g: `/uhc randomise 3`

* Note: This command requires the setting of the following config values: `random.teams.pot.1`, `random.teams.pot.2`, `random.teams.pot.3`. See [here](#randomise-team-configuration)

#### Late start player midway during a UHC

`/uhc latestart <username>`

e.g: `/uhc latestart shurf`

#### End/cancel the UHC:

`/uhc cancel`

### Notes on running your UHC smoothly

We recommend using a plugin like [Chunky](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/) to pre-load your world chunks. This will hopefully mean less lag at the beginning of your UHC.
