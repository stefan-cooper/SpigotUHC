## Configuration

### Enable evolving shields

* Note - enabling evolving shields will disable shield enchantments in the enchantment bench, if you have that configured

`/uhc set enable.evolving.shields=true`

### Set experience -> damage threshold

Set the experience threshold before levelling up the shield requires doing player damage instead of gaining minecraft exp.

You can use this to ensure that higher stages can't be grinded with an XP farm.

This defaults to -1 (no limit for minecraft XP)

`/uhc set evolving.shields.exp.threshold=2000`

## What is an evolving shield?

On UHC start, each player will be given a unique shield to them. They cannot drop, destroy or lose the shield in any way.

You can [level up](#levelling-up) your shield and [unlock upgrades](#stages) from doing so.

If you die, your shield is destroyed. It cannot be picked up by opponents, or teammates.

If you are revived, you will be given a new evolving shield that has 0 XP.

## Levelling up

As references in the prior section, levelling up your shield can be done in one of a couple ways.

### Gaining minecraft XP

Gaining minecraft XP will level up the shield (up to and including the `evolving.shields.exp.threshold` config value).

Every `n` minecraft XP equals `n` EXP for the shield.

What this means in real-world terms is (for example):

- Killing a chicken: 1-3 EXP
- Killing a creeper: 6-8 EXP
- Mining/smelting iron: 0.7 EXP per ingot

For more information, see https://minecraft.wiki/w/Experience

### Dealing damage to oponnents

Dealing damage to opponents will level up the shield. 

This can be via melee or projectile.

* Note - TNT damage is not included

Every half a heart of post-armor calculated damage equals 200 EXP

What this means in real-world terms is (for example):

- Hitting a player with full iron armor with an Iron Sword: 600 EXP (1.5 hearts of damage)
- Hitting a player with full iron armor with an Iron Axe: 1000 EXP (2.5 hearts of damage) 
- Critting an unarmored player with a Golden Sword: 1200 EXP (3 hearts of damage)
- Critting a player with full iron armor player with a Diamond Axe: 1800 EXP (4.5 hearts of damage)


### Killing opponents

Killing opponents will give you an extra bonus bit of EXP.

Killing an opponent will give a 250 EXP bonus.

## Stages
